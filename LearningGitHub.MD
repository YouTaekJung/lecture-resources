# Learning GitHub

GitHub is a key technology when it comes to software development. 

A Github repository is the fundamental building block of Github corresponds to one application or piece of code that can perform certain functions on its own.
Github provides an easy way to store your code online with built-in version control.

Github is actually two things: Git and GitHub.

* Git is an open source version control software. 
* Git is a version control software Github is built which allows developers to work on any given project simultaneously by keeping track of changes. 
If something goes wrong, Git allows you reverse the changes easily.
* “GitHub” is nothing in its own right but it represent the social network of developers built on top of Git. 

The fundamental building block of Github is a repository or ‘repo’ corresponds to one project. 
Inside each repo there are branches which are like folders and subfolders on your desktop.
Every repo has a master branch. Developers create their individual branches work on a new feature. 
Once the feature is ready, they can merge their branch with the master. 
More often than not, developers perform these operations via Git commands.

Most commonly used Git commands are:
* Clone  — Clone makes a copy of a repo to make an offline, locally stored copy of the Github repo using command `git clone (your repository url)`. 
* Branch — New code should go in a new branch using command `git branch (branch name)`. Now, switch to that branch using command `git  checkout (branch name)`
* Commit — Commit saves the changes to local repo using command `git commit -m "my snapshot" `.
* Push   — Push transfers those changes from local to the remote stored at Github using command `git push origin (branch name) --force`. 
* Pull   — Pull Request is a way to ask other devs to review your code. A PR shows the differences between two branches in green (additions) and red (subtractions).
* Merge  — Once someone has reviewed and approved a developer’s changes, it’s time for merging new code with the master branch.

That’s all you need to know to get stared with GitHub yourself.

As a next step, try out this ‘Hello World’, no coding required version of getting started with Github.
You’ll learn how to,

* Create and use a repository via Github website. 
* Start and manage a new branch.
* Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits. 
* Open and merge a pull request.

Thanks for reading.

Your Sincerely,
